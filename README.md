# Refactor Code Challenge

## Decription

* In this challenge, I had to take given code and refactor it to make it easier for browser assesibility. Since coding is evolving, old code has to be updated into the new code.
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
